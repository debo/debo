### Hi there, I am Marco De Bortoli - aka Debo 👋

- 🧑‍💻 I'm a Principal Engineer at [Codility][codility].
- 🙏 I welcome help or donations/sponsors for [Phansible][phansible].
- 🏳️‍🌈 Pronouns: he/him or they/them or debo.
- 🌍 I lived in 🇮🇹 🇩🇪 🇫🇮 🇬🇧 🇬🇮 🇦🇺
- 💬 Ask me about anything.
- 😄 Fun facts: I can touch my nose with my tongue, I can solve a Rubik's cube in less that 2 minutes (usually) and I have a fairly reasonable and logic explanation of why domino's pizza is a good takeaway choice over Italian style. I almost forgot, I grew and dyed my beard hot pink in 2019 for the cancer research; if you don't believe it [go have a look][make-it-pink] and if you can convince my wife maybe I can do it again.
